This is a game I wrote a while ago in Python. To run it, you need to have the PyGame library installed. 
The aim of this game is to get the numbers in order (notice that the numbers 1,2, and 3 are not in their correct order). 


There are three legal moves are:

1) Rotate counterclockwise (click on the right side of the game).
2) Rotate clockwise (click on the left side of the game).
3) Switch the middle four points by pairs (click on the yellow button).

Here is a screenshot from the game:
