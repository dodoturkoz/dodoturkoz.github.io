During Christmas I built a small prototype for a 2D platformer game using Unreal Engine 5 with Blueprints and a touch of C++. The game only has 4 levels as of now, but I hope to make it into a full scale platformer in the future. I might make this page into a blog post about the tips and tricks I learnt about while making this game.
